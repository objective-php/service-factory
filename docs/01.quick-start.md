Quick start with objective-php/services-factory
==================================

Pre-requisites
--------------

The most important pre-requisite needed to use objective-php/services-factory is PHP7.

If you don\'t have it installed yet, please take a look at [Official PHP
website] and read instruction about PHP7 installation on your
development machine.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to include a project with Objective PHP is to use
composer\'s \"require\" feature.

The following command assumes composer is available in your current
PATH:
``` bash
    composer require objective-php/services-factory
```


  [Official PHP website]: http://www.php.net


Basic Usage
-----------

The documentation is being worked on... here are some examples. When used together with objective-php/application,
services are usually registered by declaring them in the application configuration. Please refer to the [config directives](03.config-directives.md) documentation to learn more about it. 

```php
<?php

use ObjectivePHP\Primitives\Collection\Collection;
use ObjectivePHP\ServicesFactory\ServicesFactory;
use ObjectivePHP\ServicesFactory\Specification\AbstractServiceSpecification;
use ObjectivePHP\ServicesFactory\Specification\ClassServiceSpecification;
use ObjectivePHP\ServicesFactory\Specification\PrefabServiceSpecification;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// no dependency is required to instantiate the Factory
$factory = new ServicesFactory();

// the most simple way to get a service is to call get() with an existing class name as id
// autowiring : if Some\Class::__construct() expects dependencies as arguments, the ServicesFactory will try to resolve the dependencies and instantiate the class with expected arguments

$service = $factory->get('Some\Class');

// storing an existing object in the service factory
$config = new Collection(['directive' => 'value']);
$serviceSpecs = new PrefabServiceSpecification('config', $config);
$factory->registerService($serviceSpecs);
$configService = $factory->get('config');

// same as above but using the ClassServiceSpecs
$serviceSpecs = (new ClassServiceSpecification('config', Collection::class))
                ->setParams(['directive' => 'value']);
$factory->registerService($serviceSpecs);
$configService = $factory->get('config');

// same again, using specs factory
$serviceSpecs = AbstractServiceSpecification::factory([
                                                'id' => 'config',
                                                'class' => Collection::class,
                                                'params' => [['directive' => 'value']]
                                              ]
);
// or with
$serviceSpecs = AbstractServiceSpecification::factory([
        'id'     => 'config',
        'instance'  => $config,
        'type'  => PrefabServiceSpecification::class
    ]
);

$factory->registerService($serviceSpecs);
$configService = $factory->get('config');

// injecting dependency using setter
$serviceSpecs = (new ClassServiceSpecification('config', Collection::class))
    ->setSetters(['setDirective' => ['directive','value']]);
$factory->registerService($serviceSpecs);
$configService = $factory->get('config');

// using references

// create a first service
$directiveServiceSpecs = new PrefabServiceSpecification('config.directive.value', 'value');
$factory->registerService($directiveServiceSpecs);

// use it as reference for the second service
$serviceSpecs = (new ClassServiceSpecification('config', Collection::class))
    ->setSetters(['setDirective' => ['directive', 'service(config.directive.value)']]);
$factory->registerService($serviceSpecs);
$configService = $factory->get('config');
